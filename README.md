# My Portfolio

## Description

My motivation was to create a portfolio that could be used to show potentional employeers to see my skills with react. I built this project to test my capabilities with using react to create a web browser. This allows potential employeers to see my skill set with coding, and offers easy to navigate examples of what I'm capable of doing. I learned different ways to shape and color my webpage to create a themed enviornment.
