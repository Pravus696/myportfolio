      <h3>Background:</h3>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve always had an interest in computers/coding, and primarily self
        taught how to code for various tasks. This passion led me to self learn
        VBA, and I decided to explore other options to increase my knowledge on
        coding to allow me to turn my hobby into a professional pursuit.

      <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games with my friends, spending
        time with my cats, and researching farious facts about anything that
        catches my eye. I enjoy not only technical sides of every aspect around
        me, but also mechanical sides. I like to tinker and see how things work
        to bring me ideas for creations that I would like to do in the future.
