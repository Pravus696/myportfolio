        <h3>Professional Experience:</h3>
        <p>
            I began working at a factory in 2014. I started as a general laborer 
            for various different companies while building up my work experience.
            I started working at Amazon in 2018 and worked my way up to a supervisor position. 
            I managed a team of 80 associates and was responsible for ensuring that production 
            goals were met. I also worked closely with the quality control department to ensure 
            that all products met company standards. I have experience operating various factory 
            machines and am proficient in Microsoft Suite. I am a quick learner and have excellent 
            written and communication skills. I am also able to multi-task and manage large workloads. 
            I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp to further my skills 
            and knowledge in coding languages. I am excited to continue learning and growing in my career.
